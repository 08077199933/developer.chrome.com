# Manifest - input_components

An optional Manifest key enabling the use of the  [input.ime API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/input_ime/) (Input Method Editor) for use with ChromeOS. This allows your extension to handle keystrokes, set the composition, and open assistive windows.   
Including the key in the extension manifest is done under Permissions.
