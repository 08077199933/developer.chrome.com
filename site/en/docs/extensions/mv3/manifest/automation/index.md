# Manifest - Automation

An optional manifest key only publicly accessible on the Dev channel. Including this manifest key allows access to the [chrome.automation API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/automation/), exposing access to the automation (accessibility) tree for the browser, which can be used to programmatically interact with a page by examining names, roles, and states, listening for events, and performing actions on nodes.
